# House-Price-Prediction
🏡 Property Price Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates property prices based on various features. Such a model can help real estate firms not only price properties more consistently but also focus on developing features that significantly impact value.

📁 Dataset

housing_train.csv: Used to train and validate the model. Contains the target variable Price.
housing_test.csv: Used for final predictions. Does not include Price.

🧠 Approach & Methodology

✅ Model Used: Random Forest Regressor
📈 Performance: Achieved an R² score of 72% on the validation set
🔄 Data Pipeline:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering via pipelines
Train/Test split with validation
Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation

🛠 Tools & Libraries:

pandas, numpy
scikit-learn (for preprocessing and modeling)

📦 Output

A trained predictive model
Final predictions for housing_test.csv stored in a CSV file
